    "The 'a' treatments is a random variable. An entry in the table (e.g. *y*<sub>ij</sub>) represents the j<sup>th</sup> observation taken under variable level or treatment i.\n",

    "In ANOVA, we assumed that the output variable y is generated based on the linear model:\n",

    "<center>\n",

    "* y<sub>ij</sub>: The observed value of the target variable y, in the specified treatment & run\n",
    "* μ: Overall mean of y, regardless of treatment, and no random error involved.\n",
    "* τi: Effect on y due to the i<sup>th</sup> treatment (aka the i<sup>th</sup> treatment effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "* ε<sub>ij</sub>: Random error component that incorporates all other sources of variability in the experiment. It is convenient and common to assume ε<sub>ij</sub> ~ N(0, σ<sup>2</sup>).\n",
    "\n",
    "* i: The specific treatment applied; j: the specific run (replicated) applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "* a: Total number of treatment levels.\n",
    "* n: Total number of replicates for each treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the equation, we can see how variables and random errors are combined to affect the outcome <em>y</em>.\n",
    "If the 'magnitude' of the treatment effects is much bigger than the 'magnitude' of random errors, we have a good reason to believe that the treatment are important and make a difference to the outcome, if not, the treatment effects are not significant and could either be irrelevant in affecting outcomes or the effects are too small in the presence of random errors, ε.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Randomised Design\n",
    "The above linear model is the one-way or single-variable ANOVA model as only one variable is investigated. While carrying out the experiment, it is important to run it in random order so that the environmental differences in which the treatments are applied (aka experimental units) are as uniform as possible across units or bias randomised away. \n",
    "\n",
    "For hypothesis testing, the model errors are commonly assumed to be normal and independently distributed random variables with mean 0 and constant standard deviation at any levels of the variable. This implies that the observations of y are mutually independent and follows the normal distribution:\n",

    "### Random Effects Model\n",
    "Alternative to the fixed effects model, the 'a' treatments could be a random sample from a bigger population of treatments. Then, we would like to extend the conclusions to all treatments in the population, regardless of whether or not they were explicitly considered. Here, the τ<sub>i</sub> are random variables and the ones that were investigated is useful but not constraining. Instead, we test hypothesis about the variability of τ<sub>i</sub> and try to estimate the variability. This is called the random effects model or components of variance model.\n",

    "<!-- When our conclusion on the hypothesis of the treatment means applies to the variable levels considered in the analysis, the conclusion cannot be extended to other treatment levels that were not considered. Thus, we wish to estimate the model parameters (µ, τ<sub>i</sub>, σ<sup>2</sup>). -->\n",
